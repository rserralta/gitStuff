Video Lecture #1: Intro to Pthreads in C
The following playlist (~35 minutes) introduces how multithreaded programs can be implemented in C using the functions available in pthread library. Additionally, it covers the usage of mutex locks to synchronize the access to shared resources among different threads to avoid race condition. Finally, it shows how to create detached threads in C.

Video Lecture #1: Hash Tables in C
In the following video (~45 minutes), I explain how hash tables are implemented in C. I use separate chaining to resolve collision in the hash table. I use hash table to

implement hashset which is an efficient implementation of set abstract data type,
and implement hashmap which is an efficient implementation of a map abstract data type (equivalent to Python dictionary).
